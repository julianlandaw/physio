Morse, Cortinez and Anderson used a three-compartment PK model:
CL = 0.9 L/min/70 kg (36% population parameter variability)

intercompartmental clearances:
Q2 = 1.68 L/min/70 kg (63)
Q3 = 0.62 L/min/70 kg (90)

Volumes of Distribution:
V1 = 25.2 L/70 kg (103.9)
V2 = 34.4 L/70 kg (41.8) - rapidly equilibrating peripheral compartment
V3 = 65.4 L/70 kg (62)   - slow equilibrating peripheral compartment
